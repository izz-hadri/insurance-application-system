          Proposal Form
          <br>
          For Individual Healthcare Practitioners
          <br><br>
          Important Notices to the Applicants
          <hr>
          <b>Your Duty of Disclosure</b>
          <br><br>
          Before you enter into a contract of general Takaful with the Takaful Operator, you have a
          duty to disclose to the Takaful Operator every matter within your knowledge that is
          material to the Takaful Operatorâ€™s decision whether to accept the risk of the Takaful and,
          if so, on what terms.
          <br><br>
          You have the same duty to disclose those matters to the Takaful Operator before you
          renew, extend, vary or reinstate a contract of general Takaful. Your duty of disclosure continues
          after the application has been completed up until the contract of Takaful is entered into.
          <br><br>
          It is important that all information contained in this application is understood by you
          and is correct, as you will be bound by your answers and by the information provided by
          you in this application. You should obtain advice before you sign this applicaton if you
          do not properly understand any part of it.
          <br><br>
          Your duty of disclosure continues after the application has been completed up until the
          contract of Takaful is entered into.
          <br><br>
          <b>Non-Disclosure:</b><br>
          If you fail to comply with your duty of disclosure, the Takaful Operator may have the
          option of avoiding the contract of Takaful from its beginning.
          <br><br>
          If your non-disclosure is fraudulent, the Takaful Operator may also have the right to
          keep the premium that you have paid.
          <br><br>
          <b>Change of Risk or Circumstances:</b><br>
          You should advise STMB as soon as practicable of any change to your normal business as
          disclosed in this application, such as changes in business activities, location, acquisitions
          and new overseas activities.
          <br><br>
          <b>Subrogation</b>
          <br><br>
          Where you have agreed with another person or company ( who would otherwise be liable
          to compensate you for any loss or damage which is covered by the contract of Takaful)
          that you will not seek to recover such loss or damage from that person, STMB will not
          cover you, to the extent permitted by law, for such loss or damage.
